# SRS Document for AI/CV Pipeline

## Project Overview

### Project Description
The AI/CV pipeline is designed to execute AI models and computer vision tasks on images. It incorporates JSON-based configuration, stepwise execution, logging, tracking, data integration, scalability, and deployment with data foundation hardware. The system will also integrate with annotation tools, support local and containerized execution, and serve as an annotation tool itself.
